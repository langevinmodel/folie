Welcome to folie's documentation!
=================================





folie (Finding Optimal Langevin Inferred Equations) intends to provide a simple to use module for inference of Langevin equations from trajectories of collectives variables. Please refer to the documentation for a more complete description.


Installation
--------------

Installing the library is as simple as running

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/langevinmodel/folie.git


If you also want to install optionnal dependencies, run for the torch dependency


.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/langevinmodel/folie.git[deep-learning]

or

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/langevinmodel/folie.git[finite-element]

to install dependencies for the finite element part of the library.


Getting Started
------------------

The general pattern of using folie is defining a model, loading trajectories data, fit the model and analyse the resulting model.
